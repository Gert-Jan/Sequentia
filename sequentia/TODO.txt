BEFORE SHIPPING
- Work out the TODO's in SeqSerializerBin, making sure serialization will work well across platforms.
- Add a warning when creating a new project or opening a new project while there are unsaved changes in the current project.
- Validate command arguments

Project
- The project has a width and height, which is used for all video/image position coordinates.
	- Allow changing of the width and height
	- Add a tooltip explaining that width and height has nothing to do with export dimensions.

Export
- Add video exporting
- Allow for two export modes when having different export and project dimensions
	- Rendering natively to the export resolution (export sized rendertarget)(default)
	- Up/down scaled orginal project size (project sized rendertarget)
	- Keep aspect ratio (potentially add black bars) or stretch.

Library
- When not able to load a video (FileNotFound/Corrupt) add error code to library link, show in red.
	- try relative path on FileNotFound, notify on possible resolve.
	- allow retargeting in SeqUILibrary contect menu, when a new folder is targeted for a file:
		- try to apply on other FileNotFound errored files as well.

UI
- Library - video collection
	- Allow dragging folders and files to library windows
		- Add 'filter' virtual folders
		- Add 'links', linking to files or folders on the filesystem
		- Let's start out with only file links
	- Add a 'Scenes' tab displaying all editable non-temp scenes in the project
- Video - video or audio player
	- Allow targeting different contexts or channels to be displayed
- Sequencer - video/audio arrangement
	- Add channel collapsing
	- Add clearer channel selection color
	- Allow for changing stream index on clips (for example, change audio channel to another language)
- Clip grouping
	- Grouped clips should be connected in the Sequencer and should always have the same left time
	- When dragging in a video clip from library to sequencer a ClipGroup should be made

Video
- Add a pause function
- Figure out if we can do gpu/spu accalerated decoding with ffmpeg.

Development
- Test dev environment on another machine, write a setup guide in the README.txt
