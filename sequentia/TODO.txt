Ah quick doc to keep track of things that should be done later.

Video
- Experiment with seeking
- Add a pause function
- Find a color calibration video, check which YUV420p fragment shader matrix should be used.
- Figure out if we can do gpu/spu accalerated decoding with ffmpeg.

Audio
- Decode audio in a separate thread, so frame skipping doesn't influence audio performance
- Buffer audio data
- Feed audio data to SDL2

Graphics
- Divide the Material struct up in a Material and MaterialInstance struct.

Code
- Explore a more C-like way of doing things as opposed to how C++-like the Material and Decoder are done now. Not sure if that will make me happy but I got to try...
- Settle for a code style, it's all over the place now.
- Figure out what to do with imgui_impl_sdl_gl3, at the very least rename it.

Development
- Test dev environment on another machine, write a setup guide in the README.txt
