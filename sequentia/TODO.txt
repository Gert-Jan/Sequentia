BEFORE SHIPPING
- Work out the TODO's in SeqSerializerBin, making sure serialization will work well across platforms.
- Add a warning when creating a new project or opening a new project while there are unsaved changes in the current project.

UI
- Library - video collection
	- Allow dragging folders and files to library windows
		- Add 'filter' virtual folders
		- Add 'links', linking to files or folders on the filesystem
		- Let's start out with only file links
- Video - video or audio player
	- Allow targeting different contexts or channels to be displayed
	- Handle resizing better
- Sequencer - video/audio arrangement
	- Allow dragging videos from the library to the sequencer channels
	- Add channel collapsing
	- Add clearer channel selection color

Video
- Add a pause function
- Find a color calibration video, check which YUV420p fragment shader matrix should be used.
- Figure out if we can do gpu/spu accalerated decoding with ffmpeg.

Audio
- Decode audio in a separate thread, so frame skipping doesn't influence audio performance
- Buffer audio data
- Feed audio data to SDL2

Graphics
- Divide the Material struct up in a Material and MaterialInstance struct.

Code
- I decided that I really like having funtions acting on data and the data itself in one place especially in inherently stateful code
    Therefor: todo: transform the decoder class to a more c++-like format using the same style as used in SeqProject/SeqChannel/SeqList
- Figure out what to do with imgui_impl_sdl_gl3, at the very least rename it.

Development
- Test dev environment on another machine, write a setup guide in the README.txt
