BEFORE SHIPPING
- Work out the TODO's in SeqSerializerBin, making sure serialization will work well across platforms.
- Add a warning when creating a new project or opening a new project while there are unsaved changes in the current project.
- Validate command arguments

Library
- When not able to load a video (FileNotFound/Corrupt) add error code to library link, show in red.
	- try relative path on FileNotFound, notify on possible resolve.
	- allow retargeting in SeqUILibrary contect menu, when a new folder is targeted for a file:
		- try to apply on other FileNotFound errored files as well.

UI
- Library - video collection
	- Allow dragging folders and files to library windows
		- Add 'filter' virtual folders
		- Add 'links', linking to files or folders on the filesystem
		- Let's start out with only file links
- Video - video or audio player
	- Allow targeting different contexts or channels to be displayed
- Sequencer - video/audio arrangement
	- Allow dragging videos from the library to the sequencer channels
	- Add channel collapsing
	- Add clearer channel selection color

Video
- Add a pause function
- Find a color calibration video, check which YUV420p fragment shader matrix should be used.
- Figure out if we can do gpu/spu accalerated decoding with ffmpeg.

Audio
- Decode audio in a separate thread, so frame skipping doesn't influence audio performance
- Buffer audio data
- Feed audio data to SDL2

Graphics
- Divide the Material struct up in a Material and MaterialInstance struct.

Development
- Test dev environment on another machine, write a setup guide in the README.txt

Ideas
- Add concept of 'Scenes' between SeqProject and SeqChannel
	- When dragging one or multiple clips into the 'void' a temp scene can be spawned in a new SeqUISequencer window.
	- This could allow for intermediate editing between dragging and dropping.
	- Furthermore having different scenes allows for doing quick non destructive edits.
